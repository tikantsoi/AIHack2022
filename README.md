# AIHack2022

This is a 24-hour hackathon event organised by the Imperial College Data Science Society. In this project, we were asked to forecast energy prices using machine learning methods and create an optimisation for a flexible asset to maximise profit for a renewable energy company, Limejump. Our team (of 4) moved forward with the LSTM model, to faciliate its learning, we scaped data from the web in addition to the datasets we were already given.
